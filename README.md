# Project2 - Hive Builder

## Overview
This was our second large project as a group. We had to utilize both the knowledge of front-end coding and back-ending coding we have acquired during our time in the bootcamp program at Rutgers. In this app, we wanted to create a sister app to our previous project where users can create and manage events instead of making api calls to a pre-packaged API JSON. Instead we utilized passport.js and sequelize in order to create members and these members can then create events for other members to find.  


### Expected Outcomes
The Hive Builder app was designed to create an operational site where members can sign up and create events as well as manage events. Currently, our app is still under developement but we hope to open webforms where users can keep track of who has signed up to their event. As well as, have a community forum or chat where users can communicate with one another. 


### Built with

- [JavaScript] (https://www.javascript.com/) - The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web pageâ€™s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
- [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/)- Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript.
- [HTML5] - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
- [CSS]- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
- [Sequelize] 

### New Technology

- [Passport.js] (http://www.passportjs.org/) - Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
- [EJS] (https://ejs.co/) - What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.
